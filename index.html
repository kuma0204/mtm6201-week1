        <p> i'm a IMD student at algonquin currently living in ottawa. i'm from sri lanka. As a beginner, i find coding very interesting the more i learn it the more curious i get about this subject. I'm a very friendly person but would be shy at first. Also, i would say i'm a animal lover, personally i owned 3 dogs and 2 cats in sri lanka. And owning a horse is one of my dreams i wish to accomplish someday. in my future i would love to start my career in web devolper or ux designer. Alot of people say i'm a very quiet person, i would somewhat agree on that as i'm a introverted person but once i'm comfortable i wont be quiet for a while.</p>
