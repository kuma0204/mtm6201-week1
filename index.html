        <p> i'm a IMD student at algonquin currently living in ottawa. i'm from sri lanka. As a beginner, i find coding very interesting the more i learn it the more curious i get about this subject. I'm a very friendly person but would be shy at first. Also, i would say i'm a animal lover, personally i owne 3 dogs and 2 cats in sri lanka. And owning a horse is one of my dreams i wish to accomplish someday. In my future i would love to start my career as web devolper or ux designer. Alot of people say i'm a very quiet person, i would somewhat agree on that as i'm a introverted person but once i'm comfortable i won't be quiet for a while. I enjoy trying new food, learning about different cultures, visting art gallerys. I love to stay fit and healthy in my youth so i like to gym and go on hikes when ever i can.
        </p>
        <p>So far i like everything about canada, even though i came in the winter, i enjoyed the winter too, and the spring is making me more excited to explore this beautifull country, I wish to vist vancouver with my mom and travel around in the future. Moreover i'm very much a night person, so i'm greatful we don't have any crazy early morning classes this summer beacuse i'm not a early bird.</p>
